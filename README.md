# Python Package Exercise

A little exercise to create a Python package, build it, test it, distribute it, and use it. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

[![Build & test](https://github.com/software-students-fall2022/python-package-exercise-project-3-team-17/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg?)](https://github.com/software-students-fall2022/python-package-exercise-project-3-team-17/actions/workflows/build.yaml)


## Description

This is a lightweight, health-focused package that offers the following functionality: <br>

<ol>
    <li>Calculates a user’s Body Mass Index determines where the user falls within the BMI scale, ranging from underweight to obese</li>
    <li>Identifies diseases associated with a certain, abnormal BMI level (underweight or overweight)</li>
    <li>Describes a balanced diet consisting of the amount, in grams, of proteins, carbohydrates, fat, sugar, saturated fats, as well as food energy in calories</li>
    <li>Calculates a user’s Active Metabolic Rate, with an option for the user to get his/her Basal Metabolic Rate.</li>
</ol>

## How to Install and Use this Package

1. Navigate to your desired root directory and execute 

```
pipenv install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ amIFat==0.0.7
```

(Prof B's note: if you've previously created a pipenv virtual environment in the same directory, you may have to delete the old one first. Find out where it is located with the pipenv --venv command.)

2. Activate virtual environment with 
```
pipenv shell
```
3. Create a python program in the directory and import all the functions in the ```amIFat``` package with 

```
from amIFat import macros, howfat, calories, fat_problems
```
4. Implement the functions in your program and run it with 

```
python3 yourProgram.py
```
5. Exit the virtual environment with ```exit```
